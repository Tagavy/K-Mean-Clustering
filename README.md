# K-Mean-Clustering
## Spotify Audio Features and K-Means Clustering
This project aims to explore the effectiveness of Spotify's audio features in identifying similar songs as defined by humanly detectable criteria. Additionally, the project investigates the use of K-Means clustering to create playlists based on these audio features.

### Project Description
When listening to music, humans are able to identify similar songs within a specific genre or style. This project seeks to determine if Spotify's audio features are able to identify these similarities. The project uses data from the Spotify API to extract audio features such as tempo, key, and mode, and then applies K-Means clustering to group similar songs together.

The project also explores the use of K-Means clustering to create playlists based on these audio features. This involves clustering songs based on their audio features and then selecting the most representative songs from each cluster to create a playlist.

### Questions to Answer
The project aims to answer the following questions:

1. Are Spotify's audio features able to identify "similar songs" as defined by humanly detectable criteria?
2. Is K-Means clustering a good method to create playlists?

### Libraries and Tools Used
The project uses the following libraries and tools:

* Pandas
* Scikit-learn (sklearn)
* BeautifulSoup
* Requests
* Regular Expressions (re)
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Wordcloud
